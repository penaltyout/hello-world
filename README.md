# hello-world

Hi, my name is RIA.
I know. I know. You are just about to ask me why I wrote my name only with capital letters, right?
Well, it is about philosophy that I enherited from my father.
I can tell you a little bit about it later today so be patient.

This is my first ever repository that I created with Git.
I am so proud of myself, wow!
